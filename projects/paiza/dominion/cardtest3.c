* First Test of Dominion card: village 
* *******************************************************
* The tests occur in 4 broad categories
* 1) Check the state of the first player to gain a card.
* 2) Check the state of the other player
* 3) Check the shared state of the two players.
* 4) Check the kingdom and victory cards.
*
*
* This file was inspired by the samples provided for homework.
* The base came from paiz_card_Test_1.c.
