 I found a bug at line 1345 of the dominion.c file through my random tests. 
 It should have two actions instead of 4.
 It crashed my asserts, so I had to change my random test.
 I also found a bug at line 1331 of dominion.c through visual inspection since smithy was not drawing enough cards.
 My reports follow these lines.
